	abstract = {Summary The species abundance distribution ( SAD ) is an important concept in ecology, and much work has focused on the SAD in a theoretical context. However, less focus has been placed on the utility of SAD s in applied ecology and biodiversity management, which therefore forms the focus of the present article. We illustrate that study of the SAD allows inferences beyond those that flow from many simple diversity indices, enabling workers to identify patterns in the commonness and rarity of species in a community. First, we discuss how incorporating SAD analyses into the study of ecological communities can generate useful information for the management of biodiversity. In particular, we argue that deconstructing ecological assemblages into various subsets and analysing how each subset contributes to the overall SAD can reveal patterns of interest to managers. Secondly, we review the many applications of SAD s in applied ecological fields, including disturbance ecology, conservation planning and conservation biological control. Using examples we show that the SAD can be useful in applied ecology as it is visually intuitive, easy to implement in a broad variety of ecological contexts, and does not require substantial species‐specific data. We provide a summary of the various methods available for plotting the SAD and illustrate how each method provides information of value for applied ecologists. Using empirical and simulated data, we show that the SAD can provide early warning of the effects of disturbance on ecological communities and that a number of SAD models represent useful tools for comparing communities in a management context. Synthesis and applications . Applied ecologists require tools that allow for relatively quick assessments of ecosystem health and/or the success of management prescriptions aimed at ameliorating the effects of disturbance. We demonstrate that that the methods reviewed herein provide such tools and that the species abundance distribution ( SAD ) has additional applied uses beyond traditional applications in disturbance ecology. We hope that this synthesis will provide a catalyst for advancing a more utilitarian SAD research agenda. , Applied ecologists require tools that allow for relatively quick assessments of ecosystem health and/or the success of management prescriptions aimed at ameliorating the effects of disturbance.

	abstract = {In 2010, the international community, under the auspices of the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed on 20 biodiversity-related “Aichi Targets” to be achieved within a decade. We provide a comprehensive mid-term assessment of progress toward these global targets using 55 indicator data sets. We projected indicator trends to 2020 using an adaptive statistical framework that incorporated the specific properties of individual time series. On current trajectories, results suggest that despite accelerating policy and management responses to the biodiversity crisis, the impacts of these efforts are unlikely to be reflected in improved trends in the state of biodiversity by 2020. We highlight areas of societal endeavor requiring additional efforts to achieve the Aichi Targets, and provide a baseline against which to assess future progress. , Although conservation efforts are accelerating, their impact is unlikely to improve the global state of biodiversity by 2020. , Indicators of progress and decline The targets set by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010 focused international efforts to alleviate global biodiversity decline. However, many of the consequences of these efforts will not be evident by the 2020 deadline agreed to by governments of 150 countries. Tittensor et al. analyzed data on 55 different biodiversity indicators to predict progress toward the 2020 targets—indicators such as protected area coverage, land-use trends, and endangered species status. The analysis pinpoints the problems and areas that will need the most attention in the next few years. Science , this issue p. 241},

	abstract = {Crossing “safe” limits for biodiversity loss The planetary boundaries framework attempts to set limits for biodiversity loss within which ecological function is relatively unaffected. Newbold et al. present a quantitative global analysis of the extent to which the proposed planetary boundary has been crossed (see the Perspective by Oliver). Using over 2 million records for nearly 40,000 terrestrial species, they modeled the response of biodiversity to land use and related pressures and then estimated, at a spatial resolution of ∼1 km 2 , the extent and spatial patterns of changes in local biodiversity. Across 65\% of the terrestrial surface, land use and related pressures have caused biotic intactness to decline beyond 10\%, the proposed “safe” planetary boundary. Changes have been most pronounced in grassland biomes and biodiversity hotspots. Science , this issue p. 288 ; see also p. 220 , Land use has reduced biosphere intactness below safe limits across 65\% of Earth’s terrestrial surface, especially in grasslands. , Land use and related pressures have reduced local terrestrial biodiversity, but it is unclear how the magnitude of change relates to the recently proposed planetary boundary (“safe limit”). We estimate that land use and related pressures have already reduced local biodiversity intactness—the average proportion of natural biodiversity remaining in local ecosystems—beyond its recently proposed planetary boundary across 58.1\% of the world’s land surface, where 71.4\% of the human population live. Biodiversity intactness within most biomes (especially grassland biomes), most biodiversity hotspots, and even some wilderness areas is inferred to be beyond the boundary. Such widespread transgression of safe limits suggests that biodiversity loss, if unchecked, will undermine efforts toward long-term sustainable development.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Much biodiversity data is collected worldwide, but it remains challenging to assemble the scattered knowledge for assessing biodiversity status and trends. The concept of E ssential B iodiversity V ariables ( EBV s) was introduced to structure biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the challenges of a ‘ B ig D ata’ approach to building global EBV data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing on species distribution and abundance. The majority of currently available data on species distributions derives from incidentally reported observations or from surveys where presence‐only or presence–absence data are sampled repeatedly with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from opportunistic population counts or from population time series using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous, multi‐source data sets across space, time, taxa and different sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV data products requires correcting biases introduced by imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing measurement units from different data sources or sampling methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial inter‐ or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the development of EBV s by the G roup on E arth O bservations B iodiversity O bservation N etwork ( GEO BON ), we identify 11 key workflow steps that will operationalize the process of building EBV data products within and across research infrastructures worldwide. These workflow steps take multiple sequential activities into account, including identification and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete examples from existing citizen science and professional monitoring projects, including e B ird, the T ropical E cology A ssessment and M onitoring network, the L iving P lanet I ndex and the B altic S ea zooplankton monitoring. The identified workflow steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. They depend on clear, findable and accessible metadata, and we provide an overview of current data and metadata standards. Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV data products: ( i ) developing tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi‐source data sets and filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, ( ii ) integrating emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as citizen science, sensor networks, DNA ‐based techniques and satellite remote sensing, ( iii ) solving major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workflows and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, ( iv ) allowing semantic interoperability by developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent data and metadata, and ( v ) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on use, modification and sharing. Addressing these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and sustainable development goals.},
